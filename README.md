# MatMul Fun

## Purpose

TODO

## TODO

- Instantiate and print a small matrix
- Multiply two small small matrics naively
- Test for what dimensions in matrix multiplication will break cache coherence
  and compare against a theoretical estimate
- Optimize matmul for memory
- Implement capped-memory matmul algorithm
- Port some of the above to C++, Zig, or Rust
- Run matmul on the GPU with as little library support as possible
- Run matmul on GPU using existing CUDA libraries
